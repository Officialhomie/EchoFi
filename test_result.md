   - Cross-device message sync (SequenceId issue addressed)

2. **Message Operations**
   - Send messages to groups and DMs
   - Stream real-time messages
   - Retrieve message history with pagination
   - Handle different message content types

3. **Error Handling & Recovery**
   - Database health checks and recovery
   - SequenceId corruption detection and repair
   - Initialization failure recovery with retry logic
   - User-friendly error messages and recovery options

### Smart Contract Features
1. **Treasury Management**
   - Create multi-signature treasuries via factory contract
   - Member voting power distribution
   - Aave V3 integration for yield generation
   - Emergency withdrawal capabilities

2. **Governance System**
   - Proposal creation and management
   - Voting mechanisms with quorum requirements
   - Proposal execution with multi-signature approval
   - Role-based access control

3. **Integration Points**
   - Link XMTP groups with on-chain treasuries
   - Real-time synchronization between chat and blockchain
   - Agent-executed strategies based on group decisions

## Integration Architecture

### Data Flow
```
User Input → Form Validation → XMTP Group Creation → Smart Contract Deployment → Group Linking → Success
```

### Phase Breakdown
1. **Validation Phase** (0-10%): Parameter validation and prerequisite checks
2. **XMTP Phase** (25-40%): Encrypted group chat creation
3. **Treasury Phase** (50-70%): Smart contract deployment and treasury setup
4. **Linking Phase** (85-90%): Connect XMTP group with on-chain treasury
5. **Complete Phase** (100%): All components ready and synchronized

## Error Handling & Recovery

### XMTP Error Scenarios
- **SequenceId Synchronization**: Database reset and re-initialization
- **Cross-device Sync**: Enhanced client stability with singleton pattern
- **Network Connectivity**: Retry logic with exponential backoff
- **User Rejection**: Clear messaging and retry options

### Smart Contract Error Scenarios
- **Transaction Failures**: Gas estimation and retry mechanisms
- **Network Issues**: Fallback to alternative RPC endpoints
- **Insufficient Funds**: Clear error messaging and funding instructions
- **Contract Interaction**: Comprehensive error parsing and user guidance

## Performance Optimizations

### XMTP Optimizations
- Singleton pattern to prevent multiple client instances
- Database health monitoring and proactive cleanup
- Efficient message streaming with proper cleanup
- Optimized conversation loading and caching

### Smart Contract Optimizations
- WAGMI hooks for efficient contract interactions
- Transaction batching where possible
- Gas estimation and optimization
- Event listening for real-time updates

## Security Considerations

### XMTP Security
- End-to-end encryption for all group communications
- Secure key management and storage
- Address validation before adding members
- Proper cleanup of sensitive data

### Smart Contract Security
- Multi-signature requirements for treasury operations
- Role-based access control
- Validated proposal parameters
- Emergency withdrawal mechanisms

## Testing Requirements

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Wallet connection and network switching
- [ ] XMTP initialization and health checks
- [ ] Group creation form validation
- [ ] Member address validation
- [ ] Voting power distribution
- [ ] Group creation progress tracking
- [ ] Error handling and recovery
- [ ] Success state and group access

### Integration Testing
- [ ] XMTP + Smart Contract combined flow
- [ ] Real-time message synchronization
- [ ] Treasury creation and linking
- [ ] Cross-device functionality
- [ ] Error recovery scenarios

### Performance Testing
- [ ] Large group creation (10+ members)
- [ ] Message streaming performance
- [ ] Database recovery time
- [ ] Transaction confirmation times

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations
1. **Treasury Address Retrieval**: Need to implement event listening to get actual deployed treasury address
2. **Group Linking Verification**: Should verify the on-chain group link was successful
3. **Member Capability Checking**: XMTP message capability checking could be more robust
4. **Gas Estimation**: Dynamic gas cost estimation not fully implemented

### Future Enhancements
1. **Real-time Portfolio Tracking**: Live updates of treasury balance and yields
2. **Advanced Proposal Types**: Support for complex DeFi strategy proposals
3. **Mobile Optimization**: Responsive design improvements for mobile devices
